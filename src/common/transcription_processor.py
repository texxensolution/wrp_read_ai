           4. Dividing total operations by number of words in reference
           
           For example:
           reference: "the cat sat on the mat"
           hypothesis: "a cat sits on mat" 
           Operations: 1 substitution ("sits" for "sat"), 2 deletions ("the", "the")
           WER = 3 operations / 6 reference words = 0.5 or 50% error rate
           
           A lower WER means a higher score, indicating better match between reference and hypothesis."""
